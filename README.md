People have been having issues with crashing on their community servers.

I've been using this cfg I created to fix the issues. 

So far I've gave it to the NA tourney and the Blast1x 10k EU tourney that happened recently, both of them had their crashing problems fixed once I sent it over so it definitely works lol

[Instructions]

[Self-hosted/Dedi]

1.) Add to autoexec on server start
2.) Enjoy

[DatHost]

1.) Replace with what's inside of citadel_server.cfg
2.) Reboot, enjoy.


Also, since I've been using this for a while, and have gave it to a couple people. DatHost has just added it to their initial server setup, ur welcome
